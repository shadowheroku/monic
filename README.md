*MissKaty* is a Telegram Bot built using Python and the Pyrogram library. Many useful features for us to use. I hope that one day this project will be discontinued, someone will continue or develop it again. I gave the name MissKaty because I like cats, a cute animal that likes to be played with and friendly with humans.

python3 --version
```
- Install all dependency that needed bot to run. *(need root access, you can skip this if your server didn't have root access but some plugins will not work)*
```
apt update -y & apt install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libwebp-dev python3-pip python3-lxml git wget curl ffmpeg locales tzdata neofetch mediainfo speedtest-cli -y
```
- Install requirements.txt, if using python => 3.11, you need use venv when install pip package.<br/>
*Python < 3.10*
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
*Python => 3.11*
```
python3 -m venv nama_venv
source nama_venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

```
bash start.sh
```
